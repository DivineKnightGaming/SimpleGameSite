# SimpleGameSite
A Simple Game Site Builder for Indie Game Developers

# Simple to use
Just update the included xml file with your game's information, buy and subscribe code. You can also make some simple css changes within the xml file as well.

Then put your screenshots, header image, splash images for the feqature list and subscribe block in the provided images folder. 

Upload the three included style.css, game_info.xml, and index.php files and the images directory and all its content to your webserver and everything else takes care of itself.
